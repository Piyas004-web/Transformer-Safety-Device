The future scope of our project is particularly in Substation. In substations 
particularly during the peak hours there is a need for the operation of 
additional transformer to supply the additional load requirement. Our 
project automatically disconnects the load under critical condition. Thus 
there is no need to operate extra transformers under normal loads, 
particularly during off peak hours.
